# SurfaceAlwaysDTX

![ScreenShot](https://puu.sh/GcC63/da2dbd12db.png)

A super simple, open source reimplementation of Microsoft's SurfaceDTX tool found on the Surface Book 2.

The main reason this exists is to allow detaching of the Surface Book 2's screen, even if the battery is "too low" and the original tool prevents you. Use at your own risk.

I also made a writeup about the reverse engineering process of SurfaceDTX which can be found on my website: https://werwolv.net/blog/surface_ioctl
